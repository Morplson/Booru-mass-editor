# Booru-mass-editor
Use this script to quickly edit images at websites runing older versions of Gelbooru.

Functionality:
* It works the best on Gelbooru Beta 0.1.11: what most hostnames (*.example.com) on booru.org use
* It sort of works on newer versions of Gelbooru such as Gelbooru Beta 0.2
* Doesn't work at all on Gelbooru Beta 0.2.0 or Gelbooru Beta 0.2.5
