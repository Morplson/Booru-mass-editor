# Booru mass editor
Use this script to quickly edit images at websites runing older versions of Gelbooru.

Functionality:
* It works the best on Gelbooru Beta 0.1.11: what most hostnames (*.example.com) on booru.org use.
* It sort of works on Gelbooru Beta 0.2.
* It doesn't work at all on Gelbooru Beta 0.2.0 or Gelbooru Beta 0.2.5.
