# Booru mass editor
Use this script to quickly edit images at websites runing older versions of Gelbooru.

Functionality:
* It works the best on Gelbooru Beta 0.1.11: what most hostnames (*.example.com) on booru.org use.
* It sort of works on Gelbooru Beta 0.2.
* It doesn't work at all on Gelbooru Beta 0.2.0 or Gelbooru Beta 0.2.5.

It is not really a problem that this script only works on older versions of Gelbooru.

Gelbooru versions less than "Beta 0.2":
* Users could post images with no tags resulting in the images having the "tagme" tag
* Many boorus have vast image dumps with no tags (for example, 80% images at [meme.booru.org](http://meme.booru.org/index.php?page=forum&s=list) have no tags (23,375/29,024 images total))
* Thus, many booru really need to be tagged

Gelbooru versions equal to or greater than "Beta 0.2":
* The software forces users to have at least 4 tags
* The software is not free so the popularity of the booru has to pay for the software's cost
